## Overview of Analysis 

## Purpose 

One of the purposes of this analysis was to show a summary of the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver based on the type of city: urban, suburban and rural. The second part of this analysis consisted of creating a multiple line plot to show the total weekly fares for each city. Putting all three city types on one graph, it makes the process of comparison and visualization particularly compelling and informative. 

## Results

There are quite a few differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. There are more total rides in urban cities which has resulted in the highest total fare. As a result, there are also more drivers in urban cities. Rural cities on the other hand, have significantly less total rides and total drivers. Because there are less rides, the total fares are much less than in both urban and suburban cities. While it makes logical sense that more people would use ridesharing in urban cities where most people do not have access or own cars, but a conclusion on this cannot necessarily be drawn without statistical testing. These results are shown in the Pyber Summary DataFrame ![Pyber Summary DataFrame](/Pyber_Summary_DataFrame.png). Suburban cities have more total rides and drivers than rural cities, but less than urban cities. Thus, as shown in the multiple line graph, the line showing the suburban citiesâ€™ total fares rests in between urban and rural cities ![Total Fare by City Type](/Total_Fare_by_City_Type_graph.png). 

## Summary

The average fare for people living in rural cities is significantly higher than urban areas. This may deter people in rural areas from using ridesharing. In order to lower the costs, the CEO could look into reducing the costs to encourage more people to use ridesharing. In order to get more drivers for rural cities, the CEO could offer various incentives or promotional deals. There is a big disparity in between not only urban and rural cities but also suburban and urban cities. It may be beneficial to spend time talking with residents and drivers to see what things they would change about the system or recommendations that they may have. One such question may address why there are not nearly as many drivers in suburban cities as urban cities. Is this purely based on demand or are there other factors at play that may be contributing to the disparity?
